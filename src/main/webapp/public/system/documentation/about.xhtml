                        <h1>About CodeConnect</h1>
                        
                        <p>CodeConnect is a municipal code enforcement and occupancy 
                            inspection permitting database system created by Technology Rediscovery LLC 
                            for the Turtle Creek Valley Council of Governments 
                            between Fall of 2016 and Summer of 2018.</p>
                        
                        <p>The computer code for CodeConnect is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3 
                            which means those with technical know-how can spin up a CodeConnect 
                            server and operate their own instance of the system without 
                            paying a single penny in license fees to anybody, ever.</p>
                        
                        <p>To the non-programmer, CodeConnect's open source license may not seem 
                            important at first. However, the fact that the code base is not controlled
                            by any one person or entity eliminates the vendor/software lock-in problem
                            that has plagued organizations of all sizes who wish to switch vendors 
                            but cannot easily do so without abandoning the original system entirely. </p>
                        
                        <p>CodeConnect grew out of CMU's Heinz College culminating Systems project 
                            completed by students from both the Masters of Information Systems Management (MISM) 
                            program and the Masters in Public Policy (MPP) program. 
                            The union of the two fields created a robust project 
                            plan which was then implemented by one member of the 
                            project following graduation.</p>
