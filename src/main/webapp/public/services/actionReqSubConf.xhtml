                            to retrieve your control code again. </p>

                             <p> 
                                Requests submitted here are immediately sent to the code enforcement official 
                                handling cases in the selected municipality. Once the form has been submitted
                                you will be issued a tracking number which can be used to monitor the status
                                of your request at any time and to send notes to the code enforcement officials regarding
                                your request.
                             </p>
                            <p>
                                Please allow at least 1-2 business days for the team to 
                                conduct an initial case investigation before following up with the 
                                code enforcement team directly. Code enforcement officials will
                                contact you and concerned parties directly during the investigation process.
                                With your tracking number, you may login at anytime to view the status of your request.
