                            <p>Migration from Access was a decent success; my informal estimate from work with Kyle is about 80% of data made it in without error. 
                                Inconsistencies in dates entered into Access were magnified during the migration, and some properties with data in Access don't contain any data. 
                                Please consider creating a new case for properties in which legacy data is too inaccurate to provide useful future reference.</p>
