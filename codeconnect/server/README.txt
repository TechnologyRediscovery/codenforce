Directions for inserting the postgres driver in wildfly:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this directory, you see a module.xml file.

GO AND DOWNLOAD the current postgreSQL database driver from 

https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html

The jar should be named:

postgresql-42.2.5.jar

Then, we need to copy BOTH the jar you just downloaded and the xml into the appropriate modules directory inside wildfly's home. In the author's sample build, a path was built (by adding directories as needed) so that these two files can be stored in:

modules/system/layers/base/org/postgresql/main/

When restarted wildfly will index its module diretory tree so that when our config file asks for classes inside the postgres jar, wildfly will know where to look.

You can restart wildfly inside netbeans or with the command line configuration tools.
