-- Note: This script is not automatically generated and will become outdated as new errorcodes are added
-- It would be hilarious to have continuous integration update this script automatically when _exceptions.py is modified
-- Obviously, that is more effort than it is worth

INSERT INTO errorcode (errorcode, errorname, errordescription) VALUES
    (0, 'MalformedDataError', 'Base class for errors resulting from Malformed Data'),
    (1, 'MalformedGenericAddressError', 'Thrown when scraped address HTML doesn''t fit expected format and the error can''t be further specified.'),
    (2, 'MalformedStateError', 'Thrown when which state the parcel resides could not be parsed'),
    (3,'MalformedZipcodeError', 'Thrown when which zipcode the parcel resides could not be parsed'),
    (4, 'MalformedLotAndBlockError', 'Thrown when lot and block data could not be parsed'),
    (5, 'MalformedStreetError', 'Thrown when the street could not be parsed'),
    (6, 'MalformedOwnerError', 'Thrown when the name could not be parsed');
