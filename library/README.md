## Linux pgdiff instructions

These instructions will guide you through the process of generating SQL, reviewing it, and optionally running it on the target database. It requires a familiarity with a Linux command-line shell.

1. download pgdiff.tgz to your machine
1. untar pgdiff.tgz (a new directory will be created: called pgdiff)
1. cd into the new pgdiff directory
1. optionally edit pgdiff.sh to change the db access values... or set them at runtime (i.e. USER1=joe NAME1=mydb USER2=joe NAME2=myotherdb ./pgdiff.sh)
1. run pgdiff.sh

## tar contents
* pgdiff - a linux executable
* pgrun - a linux executable for running SQL
* pgdiff.sh - a bash shell script to coordinate your interaction with pgdiff and pgrun

If you write a Go version of pgdiff.sh, please share it and I'll include it for others to use (with your copyright information intact).
