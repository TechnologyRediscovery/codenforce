Unit tests for the parcelupdate package.

ðŸ›‘ Under no circumstance should tests connect to the production database. ðŸ›‘

The test suite assumes you have an up to date local copy of cogdb database and writes test_data to the copy.
The database (as of August 2020) is not very large, so a subset of the data is not provided.
A link to database dumps can be provided to interested contributors.

#   A note on multi-leveled classes.
#   Some test classes may only contain a single test class.
#   This is intentional:
#       It allows for more test classes to be added under the umbrella of an outer class without refactoring
