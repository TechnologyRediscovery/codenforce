This will generate a pop-up window that prompts you to choose one or more spaces to add to your checklist. You can also choose to make the spaces that you are adding to the checklist required (red circle). Note, that the 'required' flag will be added to ALL of the spaces you chose in this window.  However, you can change a required space into an optional space later (see step 8).
