# UI design formats

## Dialog headers and record content

Headers of dialogs should be of the format:
`[operation] [common string representation]`

So for property add or edit, we'd have
`Create property in COG land`

Directly under the header bar we place record metadata:
* object ID
* object created TS and user
* last updated TS and user
