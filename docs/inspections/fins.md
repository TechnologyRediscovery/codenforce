# Field inspections
Updated on 20-JUL-2023 after dashboard inspections going live.

Field inspections record the outcome of a code officer's on-the-ground assessment of a property's compliance with checklist items grouped by the space type being inspected. 

Features include:
* Municipality-specific custom checklists to match the reason and scope of inspections, such as an exterior-only checklist, a sign inspection checklist, or a swimming pool checklist
* Batch photo upload and linking of photos to individual checklist items
* Printable inspection reports with embedded photos and findings
* Easy transfer of violated checklist items into code enforcement cases to monitor compliance 
* One-click re-inspections make for slick documentation of a property's progress toward compliance

## Inspection process
1. [Locate the permit file or code enforcement case](#home) to which the inspection should be attached
1. [Start a new inspection or a re-inspection](#start) on that permit file or case
	* If creating a new inspection, choose an inspection checklist
1. [Configure inspection details](#configure): inspector, start/end times, comments
1. [Choose a space type](#spacetype) to inspect 
1. [Conduct the inspection](#conduct), adding additional spaces and taking photos as you go
1. [Upload all the inspection photos](#upload) to the inspection photo pool
1. [Attach photos](#attach) to individual checklist items
1. [Finalize](#finalize) the inspection
1. [Generate an inspection report](#report)

### Find the right place for the inspection {#home}
1. Search for and view the relevant property for your inspection. From the property profile page locate the appropriate permit file or code enforcement case to which the inspection should be attached. Navigate to the permit file or case profile page. NOTE: Only open code enforcement cases can receive a new inspection. 
    * Alternatively, if you know a permit file or case exists on the property of interest, simply find the relevant record on the dashboard search tools.
