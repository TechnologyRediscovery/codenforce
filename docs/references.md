## Official Documentation!!! Java EE
The [Java Enterprise Edition (EE)](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/index.html) is a goliath set of packages. We use java EE servlets and its entire JSF system. The [Java EE 7 platform specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/toc.htm) is the familiar javadoc generated reference.

## Markdown
Solid [markdown tutorial](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) by daringfireball which provides an overview of each syntactical element with an eye for  explanations of reasons for various features and discussions of use cases.

## PostgreSQL
The [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/index.html) is excellent and about all Eric uses.

Book: [The Definitive guide to JSF in Java II 8](https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-JSF-Java-Applications/dp/1484233867/) by Bauke Sholtz and Arjan Tijms

CoreServlets.com was Eric's online go-to for a lot of learning. [The PDFs for JSF1 and JSF2](http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial/primefaces/#Tutorial-Intro) are excellent and can be read like book chapters since they are that detailed.

Sholtz also has his [huge JSF answer index](https://jsf.zeef.com/bauke.scholtz#block_72) where he catalogs most of his own SO work.

[Sholtz's blog](http://balusc.omnifaces.org/2011/09/communication-in-jsf-20.html) with a lot of the raw content for his book in article form. 

## Primefaces
Primefaces is an open source library of enhanced JSF components. 

PrimeFaces's [showcase site](https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/) is excellent because it includes HTML and XML and JAVA for each and every component which is live to click around on.

Their [official PDF guide](https://www.primefaces.org/documentation.html) is indexed by component and is absolutely the doc to have on your hard disk.

The PF [Javadoc smells bad](https://www.primefaces.org/docs/api/6.0/), but is linked here in case it gets fleshed out.
